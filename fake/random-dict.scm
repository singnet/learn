; --------------------------------------------------------
; OVERVIEW:
; Create random Link Grammar dictionaries with specific statistical
; distributions of link-types, disjunct-lengths, vocabulary size, etc.
;
; Example Usage:
; --------------
; See `run-common/gen-dict.scm` for an example usage.
; See documentation below for description of parameters.
;
; Issues:
; -------
; This will generate grammers parts of which are "impossible".
; That is, it will generate grammars that have disjuncts that may be
; impossible to use in a sentence, because there is no way of using
; that disjunct during sentence generation.  The sentence generator
; will need to keep track of unusable disjuncts and report them.
;
; This file has some TODO's to expand the kinds and varieties
; of grammars that could be produced.

  Uses 26 lower-case ascii chars only, starting at \"a\".

  Basically, this just prints the number N in base-26, as a string
  of lower-case letters. Word 0 is a blank space, Word 1 is

(define (make-connector-generator N EXP)
"
  make-connector-generator N EXP - generator for random connectors.

  Return a generator that returns random connectors. They will be
  chosen randomly, out of N, following a Zipfian distribution with
  exponent EXP. For EXP=1, the classic Zipf diistribution is used,
  which results in the link-type 'A' being more common than 'B' ... etc.
  For EXP=0, the distribution becomes uniform, and all link types
  are equally likely.

  The connector direction will be randomly left-right with a 50-50
  probability.

;
; TODO: Implement a mode with head and tail indicators, so that
; each disjunct has:

; * Zero or more outgoing (tail/dependent) connectors.

(define (make-disjunct-generator NLINK DSIZE LINK-EXP SIZE-EXP)
"
  make-disjunct-generator NLINK DSIZE LINK-EXP SIZE-EXP - Random disjuncts.

  Return a generator for random disjuncts. Each disjunct is a
  sequence of randomly chosen connectors. Connectors are chosen
  out of a pool of NLINK different link types. The LINK-EXP is the
  Zipf exponent for chosing link types; a value of 0 gives a uniform
  distribution, a value of 1 makes the first link types more likely.

  The length of the sequence of connectors will be chosen randomly,
  but will never exceed DSIZE. The length of the sequence is given
  by the Zipfian distribution with exponent SIZE-EXP. Setting
  SIZE-EXP=1 gives the classic Zipf distribution, and most disjuncts
  will be length 1 or 2. Setting SIZE-EXP to a negative value will
  cause most disjuncts to be of length DSIZE.

  Uses 26 upper-case ascii chars only, starting at \"A\".

  make-section-generator NLKTYPES DSIZE NDISJ LINK-EXP D-EXP S-EXP
  Create random sections.

  A 'section' is a collection of disjuncts. The number of disjuncts
  in a section is controlled by NDISJ and S-EXP.  The number of
  disjuncts in a section will vary from 1 to NDISJ, following a Zipfian
  distribution with exponent S-EXP. For S-EXP=1, most sections will
  have only 1 disjunct in them, only a few will have 2 or more. For
  S-EXP negative, most sections will have NDISJ disjuncts in them.

  The size of a disjunct is controlled by DSIZE and D-EXP.

  The distribution of connector types in a disjunct is controlled by
  NLKTYPES and LINK-EXP. See `make-disjunct-generator` for details.

  Uses 26 upper-case ascii chars only, starting at \"A\".

  Each word class will have at most CSIZE different pos-tags in it.
  These will be assigned randomly following a Zipfian distribution.
  The pos-tags will be drawn randomly from a pool of size NPOS.
  The slope of the distribution is controlled by EXP, with EXP=1

  make-wall-generator NCLASS NROOTS NWALLS ENDERS - create root-word classes

  Out of NCLASS different word-classes, connect NWALLS of them to
  the left-wall. Use NROOTS different kinds of wall connector types.

  It is recommended that NCLASS be equal to or larger than NWALLS * NROOTS.

  This emulates the idea of a 'root word' in a dependency grammar.
  For example, in English, if NROOTS=1, this would be the 'main verb'
  of a sentence, which is indicated with a link to LEFT-WALL. If NROOTS
  was 2, then there would be connectors to the man verb and the main
  subject (main noun).

  ENDERS is a string containing sentence-ending punctuation marks.
  For example, the string '. ? !'. If this string is empty, no
  punctuation will be generated.

  make-sense-generator VFRAC NCLASS NSENSES EXP - create word senses

  Place a fraction VFRAC of the total number of vocabulary words into
  multiple classes picked randomly from NCLASS (with a uniform

  classes.  The number of senses will be chosen randomly, with a
  Zipfian distribution with exponent EXP.  That is, some words will
