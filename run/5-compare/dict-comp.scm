; dict-comp.scm
; Compare parses produced by two different LG dictionaries over
; a sample corpus.
;
; Usage:
; guile -s dict-comp.scm <gold-dict> <test-dict> <sentence-file>
;
; <gold-dict> should be the reference dictionary; it must be a
;        valid Link-Grammar dictionary
; <test-dict> is the dictionary that will be compared to the reference.
; <sentence-file> should be a file containing sentences whose parses
;        will be compared.
;
; Example:
; guile -s dict-comp.scm en micro-fuzz sentences.txt
;
