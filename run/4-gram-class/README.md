See `../../README-Natural.md` for more info.

A quick overview:

* `run-gram-cogserver.sh`: Starts a guile shell, runs the atomspace,
  starts the cogserver in the background, and opens the storage
  database, and loads the disjuncts from the database.

* `run-all-gram.sh`: combines all of the above steps into one.
