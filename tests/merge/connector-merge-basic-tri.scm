; Unit test for merging of Connectors - basic, simple case.
;
; Tests merging of three words into a single word-class.
; The focus here is to make sure that the CrossSections are
; merged correctly, and specifically, that the "point" of the
; CrossSection has the cluster in it.
;
; None of the sections have the words to be merged as connectors;
; this makes it "basic", since the complex connector merging logic
; is not triggered.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------
;
; This diagram explains what is being tested here:
;
; The first two words are merged as before (in the basic test):
;    (e, abc) + (j, abc) -> ({ej}, abc)
;    (e, dgh) + (j, dgh) -> ({ej}, dgh)
;    (e, klm) +  none    -> p * ({ej}, klm) + (1-p) * (e, klm)
;
; and then "f" is added:
;    ({ej}, abc) + (f, abc) -> ({ej}, abc)
;    ({ej}, dgh) + (f, dgh) -> ({ej}, dgh)
;    ({ej}, klm) + (f, klm) -> ({ej}, klm)
;
; In this diagram, (e,abc) is abbreviated notation for
; (Section (Word e) (ConnectorList (Connector a) (Connector b) (Connector c)))
; and so on.
; {ej} is short for (WordClassNode "e j") (a set of two words)
; "p" is the fraction to merge == 0.25 hard-coded, below.
;
; What about the CrossSections?
; We expect 15 to be created, 3 each for the 5 total Sections.
; For example, (e, abc) explodes to
;    [a, <e, vbc>]   and  [b, <e, avc>]  and  [c, <e, abv>]
; where [] denotes the CrossSection, and <> denotes the Shape. The "v"
; is the variable node in the Shape (that the germ of the cross-section
; plugs into).
;
; These should stay consistent with the merged sections. i.e. these
; should reduce to 12=9+3 grand-total, with appropriate counts.
; 9 of them will have {ej} as the point, and 3 will have "e" as the
; point.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Test is more or less the same as the basic test, except that now
; a third word is added, to extend an existing cluster. Specifically,
; word "f" to the existing cluster "ej".
;
; This minor variation tests a diffferent code branch than the
; initial cluster formation code.
