; lg-compare.scm -- Compare parses from two different LG dictionaries.
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Overview:
; ---------
; The general goal of the code here is to obtain the accuracy, recall
; and other statistics of a test-dictionary, compared to a gold-standard
; dictionary. This is done by creating a comparison function that can
; parse sentences with both dictionaries, and then verify the presence
; or absence of links between words.

  make-lg-comparator GOLD-DICT OTHER-DICT CLASSES - Return a sentence
  comparison function.

  GOLD-DICT and OTHER-DICT should be the two LgDictNodes to compare.
  The code assumes that GOLD-DICT is the reference or \"golden\" lexis
  to compare to, so that any differences found in OTHER-DICT are blamed
  on OTHER-DICT.

  CLASSES is a list of lists of link types in the GOLD-DICT for which
  statistics should be kept. The idea is that some link types in the
  golden dict are more important to get right than others, and so stats
  should be kept just for those.  CLASSES may be an empty list, in which
  case only overall stats are kept.

  This returns a comparison function.  To use it, pass one or more
  sentence strings to it; it will compare the resulting parses.
  When finished, pass it `#f`, and it will print a summary report.

  Example usage:
     (define compare (make-lg-comparator
        (LgDictNode \"en\") (LgDictNode \"micro-fuzz\")
        (list (list \"S\" \"O\" \"MV\") (list \"X\")) ))
     (compare \"I saw her face\")
     (compare \"I swooned to the floor\")
     (compare #f)

  By default, this does not test sentences that have words that are
  not in the test dictionary.  Over-ride this by supplying the optional
  argument INCLUDE-MISSING.
